### What is a Design Pattern?
  - A typical solution to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to
    solve a particular design problem in your code.
    
### Benefits of patterns
  - It is a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. They define a common language that helps
    teams communicate efficiently.

  - Kludges for a weak programming language.
  - Inefficient solutions

### Classification of design patterns:

1. Creational patterns - provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
    1. [Factory Method](./Factory)
    2. [Abstract](./Abstract)
    3. [Singleton](./Singleton)
    4. Builder
    5. Prototype
2. Structural patterns - explain how to assemble objects & classes into large structures, while keeping the
    structures flexible and efficient.
    1. Adapter
    2. Bridge
    3. composite
    4. Decorator
    5. Facade
    6. Flyweight
    7. Proxy
3. Behavioral patterns - concerned with algorithms & the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
    1. Chain of responsibility.
    2. command
    3. iterator
    4. Mediator
    5. Memento
    6. Observer
    7. State
    8. Strategy
    9. Template Method
    10. Visitor
